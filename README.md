# SwiftSound

SwiftSound is a project focused on exploring Xcode, the Swift programming language, and OS X application development.

The app is made based on the [Apple Developers][] tutorial on creating your [first mac app][]. However a few additional features have been added, and the app has been programmed in [swift][] rather than [objective-c][].

[swift]: https://developer.apple.com/swift/ "The swift programming language"
[objective-c]: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html "The Objective-C programming language"

The functionality of the app is very simple, it plays a sound loop, which can be adjusted in volume by a slider, a text field, or a mute button, as seen here.
